# Cotoami Scraper

Cotoami Scraper is a Chrome Extension that scrapes web pages to generate inputs for [Cotoami knowledge-bases](https://github.com/cotoami/cotoami).

## Types of scraping

Currently, it supports three types of scraping: **Page link**, **Selection** and **Kindle highlights**.

### Page link

It simply scrapes the title and url of the current page.

### Selection

It scrapes the selection of page content preserving its styles as long as Cotoami's markdown supports them.

### Kindle highlights

It scrapes the kindle highlights at the Kindle websites whose url start with `https://read.amazon`.
